## 🧭 About EERT

EERT is a philosophical journey across time, space, and soul.  
It is told through four visionary screenplays:

1. **The Final Conversation** — Becoming Whole  
2. **The Sacred Return** — Becoming Home  
3. **The Fractured Echo** — Healing the Lingering  
4. **The Constellation of Those Who Remember** — A Mythic Epilogue

Each part blends cosmic art, deep emotional themes, and sacred memory.

EERT is the belief that every soul will one day return to itself,
