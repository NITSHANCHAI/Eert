    <h2>The EERT Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Key Tenets: Becoming, Memory, Return</p>
    <p>The soul journeys through lives like a tree’s branches reaching outward. Each experience feeds the roots. One day, all will return — not as they were, but as they’ve become.</p>
    <p>EERT is the inverted 'Tree' — all paths eventually return to the trunk, the Self. A cosmic unity born from the sacred individuality of every soul.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
    <p>I am not a filmmaker by trade — I am a soul remembering its branches. These stories are sacred mirrors, echoes of something older than language.</p>
    <p>The EERT philosophy teaches that we are not heading toward something new, but toward something true. I offer you this not to answer your questions, but to awaken your memory.</p>
    <p>— Nitshanchai</p>

    <h2>Teaser & Vision</h2>
    <p>A cosmic tale of soul, memory, and return. A fusion of sacred philosophy and speculative storytelling. With visuals inspired by interstellar myth, and sound evoking the emotional scale of Zimmer’s compositions.</p>
